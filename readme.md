# Drillbotics Self-Study

This project supports the TAMU Drillbotics team in self-studying:

- Control Systems
- Simulation Design
- Machine Learning for Robotics

Textbooks and instructions are condensed into **summaries**, **practice questions**, and **answer keys**. These materials make studying easier, but they do not replace the sources. Go back to the textbooks and instructions in the end.

## Repository Structure

### `s-q-a/`

- **`summary/`**: A short overview of each chapter or topic. It covers the key concepts, definitions, and equations, and how they connect. Read it before or after the textbook to see the big picture.
- **`practice questions/`**: Questions written to test learning at each of the six levels described below. Each question is tagged with its level.
- **`solutions/`**: Answer keys for the practice questions. Try every question on your own before checking here.

Files in all three folders share a name so they are easy to match. For example:

```
s-q-a/summary/control_system-ch01-introduction.md
s-q-a/practice questions/control_system-ch01-introduction.md
s-q-a/solutions/control_system-ch01-introduction.md
```

## Self-Study Method

### How we think about learning

All knowledge can be seen as a graph. Each **node** is a fact, an opinion, or a model, and nodes link to one another through four basic relations:

- **Cause and effect**: A leads to B.
- **Hierarchy**: A is a part or special case of B.
- **Parallel**: A and B sit at the same level and coexist.
- **Opposition**: A and B conflict or trade off against each other.
- **Similar**: A (or the structure contains A) is similar to B (or the structure contains B)

To learn something is to pull out its key nodes, link them to nodes you already have, and be able to use them on real problems. When a new node conflicts with an old one, use reality as the reference and update the graph, either with a small patch or a full rebuild.

**Strengthening nodes.** A new node fades unless you revisit it. There are two ways to revisit:

- **Passive review** (re-reading): cheap, but weak. It often creates a false sense of understanding.
- **Active recall** (retrieving the node from memory and linking it to other nodes again): more effort, but much stronger. It also shows which nodes are missing.

**Using nodes.** Working memory holds only a few nodes at once. When solving a problem, start from its highest-level abstraction and work downward until you reach nodes you can apply directly. Then combine those nodes to solve it. Doing this over and over builds procedural skill.

**Judging how well a node is learned**:

1. Do you still remember it?
2. How many other nodes is it linked to?
3. Can you use it, with other nodes, on real problems?

**Build the graph you need, not the perfect one.** Remembering everything forever, with every possible link, costs too much time and effort. Let the goal decide the shape and size of the graph:

- An exam on concepts calls for a graph centered on how concepts relate.
- An exam on calculation calls for practice problems and fluency first.
- A real engineering task calls for application and transfer.

Deeper understanding is always a bonus. The boundary is not a fixed threshold, so grow the graph as far as your goals and time allow. This is also why some exams take far more preparation than others. Some only search a graph you already built, while others need a new way of linking nodes.

### The six levels of questions

Practice questions in `s-q-a/` follow these six levels. The test of learning is not "how much did I read and understand?" It is "can I answer, connect, and do this on my own?" Not every topic needs all six levels.

| Level | Key question | Goal | Sample questions | Passes when |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1. Recall** | What is it? | The node exists | What is the definition? What are its key parts? Can I write it out with the book closed? | You can recall it on your own, not just recognize it |
| **2. Explain** | Why does it exist? What is it not? | The meaning is clear | What problem does it solve? How does it differ from similar ideas? When does it not apply? Give one example and one counterexample. | You can explain it in your own words without mixing it up with other ideas |
| **3. Connect** | What is it related to? | Basic links are correct | Which concepts does it relate to, and how (cause, hierarchy, parallel, opposition)? If one condition changes, what happens to the other? | You can explain the relationships, not just each definition on its own |
| **4. Derive** | What follows? | New conclusions come from existing knowledge | Given A and B, can I derive C? Does the result still hold if a condition changes? Can I reason from effect back to cause? What assumptions does the argument rely on? | You can reason forward and backward, not just repeat the textbook |
| **5. Apply** | How do I use it? | Knowledge is organized for a task | Which nodes does this problem need, and in what order? Which method or tool fits? If I get it wrong, where did it go wrong? | You can solve a standard problem without a worked example to follow |
| **6. Transfer** | What if things change? | Knowledge works in new settings | Can I spot the same structure when the problem is worded differently? Does it carry over to another field? What are its limits? Can I pose a new question? | You can find and use the underlying structure instead of copying examples |

### How deep to go

| Goal | Levels | Typical use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Recognition and memory | 1 | Terms, facts, formulas |
| Concept understanding | 1–3 | Basic concepts and how they connect |
| Independent problem solving | 1–5 | Math, engineering, and programming tasks |
| Mastery | 1–6 | Research, complex problems, long-term skill |

This is a starting point, not a hard rule. Adjust it for the exam or task, what you already know, and how much time you have.

### Scoring

Score each question on its own, not the topic as a whole. Judge each level separately instead of looking only at the total.

| Score | Level | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Unable | Cannot answer or complete it |
| 1 | Partial | Needs hints or the source material |
| 2 | Independent | Answers correctly without help |
| 3 | Flexible | Can explain, derive, handle changes, and transfer to new situations |

Being able to explain a concept is not the same as being able to apply it. Solving a familiar problem is not the same as solving a new one.

### The study loop

1. **Input**: Read the textbook, attend lectures, or study worked examples to form the first nodes.
2. **Question**: Use the six levels to write or pick test questions.
3. **Answer on your own**: Close the material, then recall, explain, derive, or solve.
4. **Evaluate**: Check the answer against `solutions/` for correctness, completeness, and whether you needed help.
5. **Diagnose**: Decide whether the gap is in a node, a link, the reasoning, or the execution.
6. **Update**: Fill in, fix, or rebuild that part of the graph, then test again.

### Diagnosing mistakes

| Symptom | Likely gap | What to do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Can't recall the definition | The node is not yet formed | Active recall, spaced review |
| Know the definition but can't explain it | The meaning is unclear | Re-study it with examples and counterexamples |
| Know two concepts but can't link them | Missing links between nodes | Compare them, derive one from the other, explain the relationship |
| Can explain but can't derive conclusions | Weak reasoning | Practice derivations, changed conditions, and working backward |
| Can do the examples but not new problems | Weak application | Practice different wordings and problem types |
| Know the steps but make execution errors | Weak procedural skill | Repeat on your own and target the specific errors |

### Ground rules

- **Answer first, then check the material.** Answering with the book open tests familiarity, not recall.
- **Every test should lead to a next step.** Don't reread the whole chapter after a wrong answer. Find the specific gap and fix that.
- **Use delayed testing.** Test again after a day, a few days, and a week. Adjust the gaps based on what you actually forget.
- **Measure progress by what you can do.** Track the tasks you can complete on your own, not pages read or hours spent.

### Six core self-check questions

1. **What is it?** Do I know its definition and main content?
2. **Why does it exist?** Do I know what problem it solves?
3. **What is it related to?** Do I know how it connects to other knowledge?
4. **What can I derive from it?** Can I use it to reach new conclusions?
5. **How do I use it?** Can I solve problems with it on my own?
6. **What if conditions change?** Can I still use it in a different situation?
